# PCR App Debug and Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Signature Capture and Display
**Problem:** Signatures were being stored as SVG paths but not properly converted to base64 images for PDF display.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `SignatureBox.tsx` and `SignatureModal.tsx` to convert SVG paths to base64 images immediately upon capture
- Updated signature handling to save both signature data and paths for proper display
- Fixed signature display in admin PDF reports

**Files Modified:**
- `/components/SignatureBox.tsx`
- `/components/SignatureModal.tsx`
- `/app/(tabs)/summary.tsx`
- `/app/(tabs)/refusal.tsx`

### 2. ✅ ECG Capture Display
**Problem:** ECG captures were not displaying properly in admin reports despite being captured as base64 images.

**Solution:**
- ECG captures are already properly stored as base64 images from camera
- Fixed the PDF generation to properly display ECG images
- Consolidated multiple ECG captures into a single report section

**Status:** ECG images are now properly embedded in PDF reports

### 3. ✅ Trauma Body Diagram
**Problem:** Trauma body diagram data was not visible in admin reports.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive trauma injury documentation section in PDF reports
- Displays all injury locations with severity levels
- Shows anatomical mapping information

**Status:** Trauma injuries are now properly displayed in a formatted table

### 4. ✅ Refusal Signatures
**Problem:** Patient refusal signatures were showing as "not signed" in admin reports even when signed.

**Solution:**
- Fixed refusal signature handling to save both signature and signaturePaths
- Updated PDF generation to properly check and display refusal signatures
- Added proper base64 conversion for refusal signatures

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/(tabs)/refusal.tsx`

## Key Improvements Made

### Signature System
1. **Immediate Base64 Conversion**: All signatures are now converted to base64 format immediately upon capture
2. **Dual Storage**: Both signature data and paths are stored for compatibility
3. **Enhanced Display**: Signatures are properly embedded in PDFs with enhanced visibility settings

### ECG System
1. **Consolidated Display**: Multiple ECG captures are consolidated into a single report section
2. **Direct Image Embedding**: ECG photos are embedded directly as base64 images
3. **Print Optimization**: Images are optimized for both screen and print display

### Report Generation
1. **Professional Layout**: Reports now have a professional medical-grade layout
2. **Complete Data Display**: All captured data including signatures, ECGs, and trauma diagrams are visible
3. **Print Compatibility**: Enhanced print settings ensure all images print clearly

## Testing Instructions

### Test Signature Capture:
1. Go to Summary tab
2. Add nurse, doctor, and other signatures
3. Go to Refusal tab
4. Add patient, witness, and paramedic signatures
5. Submit the report

### Test ECG Capture:
1. Go to Vitals tab
2. Add vital signs
3. Click "ECG Capture" to take a photo
4. Submit the report

### Test Trauma Diagram:
1. Go to the main incident tab
2. Add trauma injuries using the body diagram
3. Submit the report

### Verify in Admin:
1. Login as admin (password: admin123)
2. Go to Data Vault > PCRs
3. Click on a submitted report
4. Click "Complete" to generate comprehensive PDF
5. Verify all signatures, ECGs, and trauma data are visible

## Technical Details

### Base64 Conversion Function
```javascript
const convertPathsToBase64 = (pathsString) => {
  if (pathsString.startsWith('data:image')) {
    return pathsString; // Already base64
  }
  
  const paths = pathsString.split('|').filter(p => p);
  const svgString = `<svg>...</svg>`;
  const base64 = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(svgString)));
  return `data:image/svg+xml;base64,${base64}`;
};
```

### PDF Image Embedding
- All images are embedded with enhanced contrast and visibility filters
- Print-specific CSS ensures images print clearly
- Images are optimized for both screen and print display

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Signatures convert to base64 on capture
- [x] Refusal signatures display in PDF
- [x] ECG images display as captured photos
- [x] Trauma diagram data shows in reports
- [x] All signatures visible in admin PDF
- [x] Professional report structure maintained
- [x] Print compatibility verified

## Notes

- The app now properly handles all signature and image data
- All captured content is embedded directly in PDFs for maximum compatibility
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- Enhanced print settings ensure all content prints clearly

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requested issues have been debugged and fixed. The app now properly:
1. Captures and displays all signatures
2. Shows ECG photos as captured
3. Displays trauma body diagram data
4. Generates professional PDF reports with all content visible and printable
