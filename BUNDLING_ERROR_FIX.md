# Bundling Error Fix Guide

## üîç Identified Issue

The current build error is caused by **jimp-compact** failing during iOS prebuild process. This is a common issue with image processing during Expo builds.

## ‚ùå Current Problem

The error shows:
```
at /Users/expo/workingdir/build/node_modules/jimp-compact/dist/jimp.js:1:7613
bun expo prebuild --no-install --platform ios exited with non-zero code: 1
```

This indicates that jimp-compact (image processing library) is failing during the iOS prebuild process.

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Step 1: Run the automated fix**

```bash
chmod +x fix-jimp-issue.sh
./fix-jimp-issue.sh
```

**Step 2: Manual fix if needed**

```bash
# Clear all caches
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .expo
rm -rf /tmp/metro-*
rm -rf /tmp/haste-*

# Clear Expo cache
npx expo install --fix

# Try prebuild again
bun expo prebuild --no-install --platform ios --clear
```

**Step 3: Alternative approach**

If the above doesn't work, try disabling image optimization:

```bash
# Set environment variable to skip image processing
export EXPO_IMAGE_UTILS_NO_SHARP=1
bun expo prebuild --no-install --platform ios
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative Solutions

If the above doesn't work, try these steps in order:

### 1. Reset Metro Cache
```bash
npx expo start --clear
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### 2. Clean Install
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .expo
npm install
```

### 3. Check for TypeScript Errors
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
node fix-bundling-error.js
```

### 4. Verify Dependencies
Make sure all your dependencies are compatible:
- React Native 0.79.1
- Expo SDK 53
- All other packages should be compatible with these versions

## üîß Manual Fix Instructions

If you can't edit app.json directly:

1. **Backup your current app.json**
2. **Create a new app.json** with the correct structure
3. **Copy all other configurations** except the malformed entitlements
4. **Test the build**

## üì± Expected Result

After fixing, your app should:
- ‚úÖ Bundle successfully
- ‚úÖ Start without errors
- ‚úÖ Run on both iOS and Android
- ‚úÖ Maintain all existing functionality

## üö® If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Metro logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all imports** are correct
3. **Check for circular dependencies**
4. **Ensure all required files exist**

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these solutions:
1. Share the exact error message from Metro bundler
2. Check if any recent changes were made to configuration files
3. Verify that all team members have the same Node.js version

**Quick Fix Summary:**
The main issue is in your `app.json` file - remove the nested `"com"` object from the entitlements and keep only the flat structure.
